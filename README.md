1. You need to install [Metamask Browser Extension](https://metamask.io/) and create an ethereum account.
2. We suggest to use Ropsten Test (you can choose it in Metamask).
3. To deploy the smart contract, you can use [Remix Browser Solidity IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
4. Then modify `contractAddress` variable in `Web/index.js`.
5. To add record, use `update.html`.
6. To view data, use `start.html`. (Currently we need Metamask to view it.)
